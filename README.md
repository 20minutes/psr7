# PSR-7 Message Implementation

This repository contains a [PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message-meta.md)
message implementation, several stream decorators, and some helpful
functionality like query string parsing.

Note:

> Some of the code in this library is based on or inspired by the PSR-7 message
> implementation by Matthew Weier O'Phinney: https://github.com/phly/http.
